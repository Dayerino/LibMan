a library management system, its a monolith so i used sqlite3 as the database since it does not require any networking or communication

user can add,modify and delete books as well as check the books currently available alongside their description, the program is mostly text, ui wasnt a big priority for me with this project

i havent used proper database organizational standards (for example the primary key for each book is the book's title instead of its ID number), i will be improving on this for my next project 

plans.txt serves as a small diary which describes my thought process while working on this project, (this should have taken me less than a week to finish i know)
