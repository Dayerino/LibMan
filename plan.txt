plan:
make a monolith (front and backend in the same project)
front end is a simple ui interface that can:
1 show books in the inventory (book class)
2 add books to the inventory (admin login)
3 remove books from the inventory:
3.1 books can get loaned out to users
3.2 books can get fully removed
3.3 books can be returned to the inventory
4 choose a pattern for the ui and the gateway and the backend
three layers: 
4.1 Presentation: basically the ui
4.2 domain logic that is the real point of the system (point #3)
4.3 data source (communication with the database)
ui design:
a smaller window inside, with the logo(?) or just something that says Lib Manger or something like that(done)
    buttons:
        show books button->clicking on a book displays information about it(might not need this and simply load all available books on start)
        a button to add a book
        a button to remove/edit a book from inventory
Domain logic choice: 
transaction script; there will be a method for each action the admin can take
checkInventory()
AddBook()
LoanBook()
returnBook()
RemoveBook()
each one of these updates the database
checkInventory sends a query to the database and returns a list of all books in the library
for users: they can only check which books are available,request to get one and return one
so we'll have a database with all books in it, the ones that are available are shown as, while the ones that are loaned are shown as loaned to a user
books class:
private:
string bookName
int BookId(store them as a hashmap id = key)
string AuthorName (might add this)
public:
setters:
void setBookName(string arg){
    this->bookName = arg;
}
void setBookTitle(string arg){
    this->BookTitle = arg;
}
void setBookId(int arg){
    this->BookId = arg;
}
void setAuthorName(string arg){
    this->AuthorName = arg;
}
getters:
string getBookName(){
    return this->bookName:
}
string getBookTitle(){
    return this->BookTitle
}
int getBookID(){
    return this->BookId
}
string getAuthorName(){
    return this->AuthorName
}
constructor:
createBook(string BookName,string BookTitle,int BookId,string AuthorName){
    setBookName(BookName);
    setBookTitle(BookTitle);
    setBookId(bookID)
    setAuthorName(AuthorName);
}
alt constructor:
Book(string bookName,string BookTitle,int BookId,string AuthorName):bookName(bookName),BookTitle(BookTitle),bookID(bookID),AuthorName(AuthorName){}
03/11/25 update:
ui is pretty much done, next steps to take are:
make a book class and display its information on the UI BEFORE starting work on the database and the transaction script
05/11/25 update:
will work on adding 3 text files, each of them will save its text to one of the three args for creating an object
then a button to create the book will show up, how to save it will be worked on later

will start writing here to keep track:
current problem is loss of data when editing, basically when i edit a book its not being properly updated and some other book is losing data(name & author name)
but description remains the same
modify works, but after modifying or deleting a book, adding a new one will put it over the last one
//11/12/25
here's the problem im seeing rn:
inside the database are 6 books, 2 of them share the same id(this shouldnt happen)
//

books vec has 10 elements(?):
shitt azer 1 //in the db
third modified dsq 3 //in the db
sixth modified again2 rere 7 // in the db
negaah rawr 9 // in the db
ninth fr modified sarze 9 // in the db (duplicate id)
//the ones below are copies that shouldnt exist
shitt azer 1
third modified dsq 3
sixth modified again2 rere 7
negaah rawr 9
ninth fr modified sarze 9
//fixed issue of books being duplicated inside the books vec
