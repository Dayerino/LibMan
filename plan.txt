plan:
make a monolith (front and backend in the same project)
front end is a simple ui interface that can:
1 show books in the inventory (book class)
2 add books to the inventory (admin login)
3 remove books from the inventory:
3.1 books can get loaned out to users
3.2 books can get fully removed
3.3 books can be returned to the inventory
4 choose a pattern for the ui and the gateway and the backend
three layers: 
4.1 Presentation: basically the ui
4.2 domain logic that is the real point of the system (point #3)
4.3 data source (communication with the database)

Domain logic choice: 
transaction script; there will be a method for each action the admin can take
checkInventory()
AddBook()
LoanBook()
returnBook()
RemoveBook()
each one of these updates the database
checkInventory sends a query to the database and returns a list of all books in the library
